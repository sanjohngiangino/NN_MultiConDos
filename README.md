Multi-ConDoS ⚡ PyTorch Lightning ⚡

John Mark Alexis Marcelo - 1850518 

My notebook aims to implement Multi-ConDos in PyTorch Lightning ⚡, a novel approach for multimodal contrastive self-supervised medical image segmentation designed to address domain shift and multimodality challenges. It employs a novel strategy that combines CycleGAN and Pix2Pix to facilitate domain translation, essential for managing multimodal data. Additionally, it introduces domain sharing layers to capture both domain-specific and shared information across modalities.

SYSTEM USED: MacOS 14.2.1

INSTRUCTION:

1)INSTALL
!pip install torch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-lightning matplotlib numpy

2)OPEN MultiConDos_Light.ipynb

3)UNZIP DATA.zip and modify
     DATA_CONFIG with your desired path for train the DSGAN (one for t1ce and one for t2)
     DATA_CONFIG_FINE for the finetuning part (one for t1ce and one for the mask)
   
4)RUN ALL

5)FINAL RESULTS:
     
     We can see here on the first raw the loss of the DSGAN
     
     On the second row we see some mask generated by the finetuning
