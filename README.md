Multi-ConDoS ⚡ PyTorch Lightning ⚡

John Mark Alexis Marcelo - 1850518 

My notebook aims to implement Multi-ConDos in PyTorch Lightning ⚡, a novel approach for multimodal contrastive self-supervised medical image segmentation designed to address domain shift and multimodality challenges. It employs a novel strategy that combines CycleGAN and Pix2Pix to facilitate domain translation, essential for managing multimodal data. Additionally, it introduces domain sharing layers to capture both domain-specific and shared information across modalities.
